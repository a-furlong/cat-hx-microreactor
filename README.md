# cat-hx-microreactor
Catalystic Heat Exchange Microreactor for Oxy-Fuel Combustion Reduced Order Modelling
Developed in Python with Cantera for reactions and fluid properties
Main components consist of cross-flow heat exchanger modelling in micro-channels and catalyzed reactions in packed beds

Cross-flow heat exchanger model:
Shows hot gas flow in one direction with utility flow in a cross-flow setup, with a discretized grid representing locations in a printed circuit heat excahanger. Includes developing laminar flow region correlations for heat transfer and pressure drops. Neglects heat transfer between channels of the same fluid.
